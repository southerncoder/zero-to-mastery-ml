    "\n",
    "And since machine learning is all about turning data into numbers and then figuring out the patterns, NumPy often comes into play.\n",

    "## Why NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do numerical calculations using pure Python. In the beginning, you might think Python is fast but once your data gets large, you'll start to notice slow downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons you use NumPy is because it's fast. Behind the scenes, the code has been optimized to run using C. Which is another programming language, which can do things much faster than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of this being behind the scenes is you don't need to know any C to take advantage of it. You can write your numerical computations in Python using NumPy and get the added speed benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your curious as to what causes this speed benefit, it's a process called vectorization. [Vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization) aims to do calculations by avoiding loops as loops can create potential bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy achieves vectorization through a process called [broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html#module-numpy.doc.broadcasting)."

    "\n",
    "The NumPy library is very capable. However, learning everything off by heart isn't necessary. Instead, this notebook focuses on the main concepts of NumPy and the `ndarray` datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the `ndarray` datatype as a very flexible array of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we'll look at:\n",
    "* NumPy datatypes & attributes\n",
    "* Creating arrays\n",
    "* Viewing arrays & matrices (indexing)\n",
    "* Manipulating & comparing arrays\n",
    "* Sorting arrays\n",

    "If you get stuck or think of something you'd like to do which this notebook doesn't cover, don't fear!\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended steps you take are:\n",
    "1. **Try it** - Since NumPy is very friendly, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
    "2. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem in the following places (either via a search engine or direct):\n",
    "    * [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) - The ground truth for everything NumPy, this resource covers all of the NumPy functionality.\n",
    "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
    "    * [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT is very good at explaining code, however, it can make mistakes. Best to verify the code it writes first before using it. Try asking \"Can you explain the following code for me? {your code here}\" and then continue with follow up questions from there. Avoid straight copying and pasting and instead, only use things that you could yourself reproduce with adequate effort.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example of searching for a NumPy function might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"how to find unique elements in a numpy array\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching this on Google leads to the NumPy documentation for the `np.unique()` function: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 2 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't have to learn all of the functions off by heart to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is continually asking yourself, \"what am I trying to do with the data?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by answering that question and then practicing finding the code which does it.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is broadcasting?\n",
    "    - Broadcasting is a feature of NumPy which performs an operation across multiple dimensions of data without replicating the data. This saves time and space. For example, if you have a 3x3 array (A) and want to add a 1x3 array (B), NumPy will add the row of (B) to every row of (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rules of Broadcasting\n",
    "    1. If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.\n",
    "    2. If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
    "    3. If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**The broadcasting rule:**\n",
    "In order to broadcast, the size of the trailing axes for both arrays in an operation must be either the same size or one of them must be one."
